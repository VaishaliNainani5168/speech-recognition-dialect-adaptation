# Speech Recognition and Dialect Adaptation

## Overview
This project aims to build an AI-based speech recognition system capable of adapting to different dialects using models like Whisper or Wav2Vec2. The goal is to improve transcription accuracy for various accents and dialects.

## Features:
- Speech recognition with dialect adaptation.
- Fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 model for ASR.
- Real-time transcription and error correction using NLP.

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-dialect-adaptation.git
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

Usage:
Upload an audio file to transcribe and get dialect-adapted transcriptions.
